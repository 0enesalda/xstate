If you want to download and play Captain America Super Soldier on your Wii, you will need the following:
 
- A Wii console with a modchip or a softmod that allows you to run backup games.
- A USB flash drive or an external hard drive with enough space to store the game file.
- A computer with a program that can extract RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7zip.
- A program that can convert ISO files to WBFS files, such as Wii Backup Manager.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the game file from one of the links below. The file is split into two parts, so you will need to download both parts and save them in the same folder.
2. Extract the RAR file using WinRAR or 7zip. You will get an ISO file named SFQE8P-Captain\_America\_Super\_Soldier.iso.
3. Open Wii Backup Manager and click on Files > Add > Files. Browse to the folder where you saved the ISO file and select it. Click on Transfer > WBFS File. Choose a destination folder for the WBFS file and click OK.
4. Connect your USB flash drive or external hard drive to your computer and format it to FAT32 if it is not already. Copy the WBFS file to your USB device in a folder named wbfs.
5. Eject your USB device from your computer and plug it into your Wii console. Turn on your Wii and launch the backup loader of your choice, such as USB Loader GX or Wiiflow. Select Captain America Super Soldier from the game list and enjoy!
