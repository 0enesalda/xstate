Dogtown and Z-Boys (2001) is not only a documentary about skateboarding, but also a tribute to the subculture and lifestyle of the Z-Boys. The film shows how they influenced the music, fashion, and art of their era, as well as the future generations of skateboarders. The film also explores the personal struggles and conflicts of the Z-Boys, such as drug addiction, fame, and rivalry.
 
The Z-Boys were a group of friends who grew up in Dogtown, a rough neighborhood in Venice Beach. They were originally surfers who hung out at the Zephyr surf shop, owned by Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom. They formed a skateboarding team called the Zephyr Competition Team (ZCT), coached by Peralta. They used their surfing skills and techniques to skate on empty swimming pools, schoolyards, and streets. They invented new tricks and maneuvers, such as aerials, slides, and grinds. They also developed a distinctive style and attitude, wearing Vans shoes, Levi's jeans, and Zephyr T-shirts.
 
The Z-Boys became famous after they participated in the 1975 Del Mar National Championships, where they stunned the audience and judges with their radical performance. They were featured in magazines such as Skateboarder and Thrasher, and became celebrities in the skateboarding world. However, fame also brought problems to the Z-Boys. Some of them left the Zephyr team to join other sponsors or start their own companies. Some of them fell into drugs or crime. Some of them quit skateboarding altogether.
 
Despite their differences and difficulties, the Z-Boys remained friends and legends in skateboarding history. They inspired many skateboarders to follow their footsteps and push the boundaries of the sport. Dogtown and Z-Boys (2001) is a film that celebrates their legacy and spirit.
