## Step 1: Install Gerix Wifi Cracker on Android
 
To install Gerix Wifi Cracker on your Android device, you will need to download the apk file from SourceForge[^2^] and install it manually. You will also need to install BusyBox and Terminal Emulator from the Google Play Store. Make sure you have root access and a custom kernel that supports wireless injection on your device. You can check if your device is compatible by running the following command in Terminal Emulator:
 `iw list | grep -i monitor` 
If you see something like "Supported interface modes: \* IBSS \* managed \* AP \* AP/VLAN \* monitor", then your device is compatible. If not, you will need to find a custom kernel that supports wireless injection for your device model.
 
## Step 2: Launch Gerix Wifi Cracker on Android
 
To launch Gerix Wifi Cracker on your Android device, open Terminal Emulator and type the following command:
 `su` 
This will grant root access to Terminal Emulator. Then type the following command:
 `cd /data/data/com.droid.developer.wifipassword/files/gerix-wifi-cracker` 
This will change the directory to where Gerix Wifi Cracker is installed. Then type the following command:
 `python gerix.py` 
This will launch Gerix Wifi Cracker with a graphical user interface. You should see something like this:

## Step 3: Scan for wifi networks with Gerix Wifi Cracker on Android
 
To scan for wifi networks with Gerix Wifi Cracker on your Android device, click on the "Scan" tab and then click on the "Start Scan" button. This will start scanning for nearby wifi networks and display them in a list. You can see the network name (ESSID), encryption type (WEP, WPA, WPA2), channel number, signal strength (PWR), MAC address (BSSID), and number of clients (STATION) for each network. You can also filter the networks by encryption type or channel number using the drop-down menus at the top.
 
## Step 4: Hack into wifi networks with Gerix Wifi Cracker on Android
 
To hack into wifi networks with Gerix Wifi Cracker on your Android device, select a network from the list and click on the "Attack" tab. Depending on the encryption type of the network, you can choose different attack methods. For example, if the network is WEP-encrypted, you can use ARP request replay or chop-chop attack to capture enough data packets to crack the WEP key. If the network is WPA-encrypted, you can use deauthentication attack or WPS attack to capture the handshake or PIN code of the network. For more details on how to use each attack method, you can refer to the official documentation of Gerix Wifi Cracker[^2^]. Once you have captured enough data packets or handshake or PIN code of the network, you can use Aircrack-ng or Reaver to crack the password of the network.
 
## Step 5: Edit wifi packets with ACDSee Photo Editor
 
To edit wifi packets with ACDSee Photo Editor, you will need to download and install ACDSee Photo Editor from Uptodown[^1^]. ACDSee Photo Editor is a powerful photo editing software that can also edit raw data files such as wifi packets. To edit
